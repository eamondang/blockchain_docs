* Decentralized Models
+ Permissionless Blockchain - Public Blockchain
  + Anyone can access to write the data
  + Anyone can read the data
+ Permissioned Blockchain - Private Blockchain
  + Participants need permission to accessing
  + Readers need permission
  + Ex: Hyperledger, Corda
+ Consortium Blockchin
  + Participants need permission to accessing
  + Anyone can read the data
  + Ex: Ripple
